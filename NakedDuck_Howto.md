# The Naked Duck #

Now trigger multiple payloads!

## Version 2 ##
### Setup ###
You can create upto 4 files on the sdcard, and have a suited ducky (USB case on...)
  1. **inject.bin** - default; ducky will always run this on insertion into a computer
  1. **inject2.bin**
  1. **inject3.bin**
  1. **inject4.bin**

### Trigger ###
Now how do we trigger additional payloads???

With the ducky still connected enable either:
  1. NUM\_LOCK (inject2.bin)
  1. CAPS\_LOCK (inject3.bin)
  1. SCROLL\_LOCK (inject4.bin)

**Warning**: use of these special keys in DuckyScript - will trigger additional payloads, meaning payloads may collide / interfere!

## Version 1 ##
### Setup ###
You need to create 3 files on the sdcard, and have a naked ducky (no case)
  1. **inject.bin** - default; ducky will always run this on insertion into a computer
  1. **inject2.bin**
  1. **inject3.bin**

### Trigger ###
Now how do we trigger inject2/3.bin???

With the ducky still connected and naked (no case, sucks I know), enable either
  1. NUM\_LOCK (inject2.bin)
  1. CAPS\_LOCK (inject3.bin).

Then push the reset switch on the naked duck, to trigger the 2nd/3rd payload.
